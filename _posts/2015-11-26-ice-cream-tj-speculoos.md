### First Impression
I didn't really know what to expect with this ice cream. It claims to have a vanilla ice cream base with swirls of Speculoos(Belgian cookies). I love Biscoff's Cookie Butter, so any ice cream with chunks of cookie butter will likely suit me just fine. Like most ice creams, you can't really get a good feel for what's inside until you take a few spoonfuls. The first spoonful left me impressed.

### Texture

I thought I would find the vanilla base boring, but it turned out well. It is definitely on the premium side with little overrun(air whipped in). There are lots of speculoo chunks mixed in, with a concentration in the middle. The speculoos have a chewyness to them that I wasn't expecting.

### Flavor
The speculoo chunks are not as strong as the Biscoff butter, but that works out pretty well. I think if they were that strong it might lead to too much of a sugar rush. The base compliments the sweet ginger-bready taste of the cookie butter. It is a simple but successful combination of two flavors.
