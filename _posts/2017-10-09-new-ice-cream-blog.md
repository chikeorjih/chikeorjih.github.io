After some consideration, I have decided to move all my ice cream craziness into its own blog. So without further ado...


[Lactose and Tolerant](http://www.lactoseandtolerant.com/) is finally live. Head over there to check out all my old and new ice cream reviews. It Ain't Easy Being Cheesy will focus on all my other nerdiness/food realted posts. I will still leave my old ice cream reviews on here but all new ice cream reviews will be on [Lactose and Tolerant](http://www.lactoseandtolerant.com/). Enjoy!
